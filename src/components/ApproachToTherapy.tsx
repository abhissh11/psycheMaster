          We understand that living with epilepsy can often bring emotional,
          social, and psychological hurdles, not just for the individual but
          also for their families and caregivers. From dealing with anxiety and
          stress to addressing feelings of isolation or stigma, our tailored
          counseling services are designed to provide compassionate support
          every step of the way. At our core, we believe that no one should face
          these challenges alone. Let&apos;s work together to nurture mental and
          emotional strength, one step at a time.
